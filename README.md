lab class activity three, all practice questions
ND Arrays and Nested Loops Practice Questions  
1. Write a C program that performs complete matrix analysis on a 3×3 matrix. Your program should 
handle all major operations including transpose, determinant, cofactor, adjoint, and inverse 
using only nested loops. Ensure that all stages are clearly displayed.  
2. Write a C program that reads a 2D matrix (up to 5×5) and determines which type(s) of matrix it 
is. Check and display whether the matrix is:  
• Square Matrix  
• Rectangular Matrix  
• Zero Matrix  
• Identity Matrix  
• Diagonal Matrix  
• Scalar Matrix  
• Upper Triangular Matrix  
• Lower Triangular Matrix  
• Symmetric Matrix  
• Skew-Symmetric Matrix  
• Singular / Non-Singular  
• Equal Matrix (if comparing two matrices)  
• Row Matrix  
• Column Matrix  
• Null Matrix  
• Idempotent Matrix  
• Nilpotent Matrix  
Clearly print all matrix types that apply. If multiple types apply (e.g., Identity is also Diagonal), 
display all.  
3. Write a C program to multiply two matrices (maximum size 3×3). The program should validate 
dimensions before multiplication and perform the process using three nested loops. Display all 
matrices involved and the result.  
4. Create a C program using a 3×3×3 3D array. Compute analytical results for each 2D layer, 
including layer-wise totals and overall data insights. Use proper traversal logic to ensure all 
elements are processed.  
5. Implement a C program that manages a 3×3×3 matrix set and examines layer similarity. Your 
program should determine whether different 2D layers within the 3D array are identical or 
distinct, reporting comparisons comprehensively.  
2DARRAYS AND NESTED LOOPS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE USED FOR SOLVING THE 
FOLLOWING EXERCISES.  
1. Write a C program that takes 5 integers in an array and shifts all elements one position to the right 
and moves the last element to the first position.  
Example:  
Input → 1 2 3 4 5  
Output → 5 1 2 3 4  
2. Write a program that reads the 10 numbers from user and store these numbers into an array of 
same size. You program should provide a search mechanism in such a way that how many times a 
particular number occurred and then print it on screen. If number is not in array, then program 
should display a message “number not found”.  
3. Sir. Talha Shahid ask you to write you a program which can help him in storing your quiz marks for 
pass students within range [5-10] will be stored, consider there are 10 students registered in Section 
BDS-1A. He wants another array of same size where marks for failed students within range [0-5] are 
stored. Write a program for the given scenario. Your program should exit if user enters -1 and will 
display the marks entered along with average of each array.  
4. Your class teacher asks you to develop a program that can help in converting mixed-case messages 
entered by users. The program should read a sentence using scanf(&quot;%[^\n]&quot;, str); and 
then convert all lowercase letters to uppercase and all uppercase letters to lowercase, without using 
any string library functions. Finally, display the converted message back to the user. Example: Input 
→ HeLLo WoRLd → Output → hEllO wOrlD  
5. Write a program that reads 10 integers into an array. Finds and prints the difference (max - min) 
between the largest and smallest elements.  
6. You are assisting your English language teacher who wants to analyze how many vowels and 
consonants appear in students’ submitted words. Write a program that reads a single word using 
scanf(“%[^\n]”, str); and counts the number of vowels and consonants in it without using any string 
library functions like strlen(). The program should then display both counts on the screen.  
7. You are working in a data management department where you are asked to remove duplicate entries 
from a list of recorded IDs. Write a program that takes 10 integers from the user and stores them in 
an array. The program should replace every duplicate element (after its first occurrence) with -1 to 
mark it as a duplicate and then display the final updated array on the screen. Example: Input → 2 3 5 
3 5 9 1 2 8 1 → Output → 2 3 5 -1 -1 9 1 -1 8 -1  
8. Write a program that reads a string using scanf(“%[^A-Za-z]”, str); so that it accepts and stores all 
characters except alphabets. The program should then display the entered non-alphabetic characters 
on the screen.
